# Specifications

Game consists of a star rating, a move counter and a timer. Timer starts once the user starts playing. The move counter increases with every move that the user makes. The star rating depends on the amount of moves that the user makes. The rating decreases with increasing number of moves made by the player. The reset button can be used to reset the game at any time and the user can then play the game again. 

# Winning condition

The player wins when all the cards are matched. The user can then play again and the whole board is reset. The game goes on, as long as the user gets the matching pairs of all elements on screen
